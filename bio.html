            I am passionate about giving people tools to make their life easier and fun. As someone who has taught
            corporate classes in Retail Math and Advanced Excel, I believe in removing any intimidating barriers so all
            may be included in using technology.<br>I thrive working in a team enviromnment, as I believe that everyone,
            regardless of experience level, has wisdom to share with me.

            I am a recovering math nerd who was (rightfully) accused of calculating his batting average on the way to
            first base in little league. In a prior life I worked in corporate retail with a focus on e-commerce, and if
            you are of a certain age, you would have found me playing rock music in NYC bars.
